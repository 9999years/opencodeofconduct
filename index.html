<div class="page-header"> <h1>Open Code of Conduct</h1> <p class="lead">An easy to reuse open source code of conduct for communities</p> </div>

<p><i>The purpose of creating this effort was to promote more open source organizations and projects to adopt code of conducts. Through our experiences at the <a href="https://twitter.com/todogroup">@TODOGroup</a>, we strongly believe that code of conducts help set the ground rules for participation in communities and more importantly, help build a culture of respect. We hope by <a href="https://github.com/opencodeofconduct/opencodeofconduct.github.io">sharing this with you</a> will enable you to easily establish a code of conduct for your respective open source community.</i></p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>

 <p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for
all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. </p>

 <p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

 <ul> <li><b>Be open</b>: We invite anyone to participate in any aspect of our projects. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by a contributor who demonstrates the
required capacity and competence.</li> <li><b>Be considerate</b>: People use our work, and we depend on the work of others. Consider users and colleagues before taking action. For example,
changes to code, infrastructure, policy, and documentation may negatively impact others.</li> <li><b>Be respectful</b>: We expect people to work together to resolve conflict, assume good
intentions, and act with empathy. Do not turn disagreements into personal attacks.</li> <li><b>Be collaborative</b>: Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. We
strive for transparency within our open source community, and we work closely with upstream developers and others in the free software community to coordinate our efforts.</li> <li><b>Be
pragmatic</b>: Questions are encouraged and should be asked early in the process to avoid problems later. Be thoughtful and considerate when seeking out the appropriate forum for your questions.
Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.</li> <li><b>Step down considerately</b>: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, they
should make it known and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.</li> </ul>

 <p>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in
the letter. </p>

 <h3>Diversity Statement</h3>

 <p> We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we all agree that everyone is equal. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully,
and do our best to right the wrong. </p> <p> Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected
characteristics above, including participants with disabilities. </p>

 <h3>Reporting Issues</h3>

 <p> If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by emailing <b>[an email address]</b>. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include: </p> <ul> <li>Your contact information.</li> <li> Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please
include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger),
please include a link.</li> <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li> </ul>

 <p> After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally. The representative will then review the incident, follow up with any additional
questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. </p> <p> Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the representative may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community without warning. </p>
